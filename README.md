### Female adolescents feel more distress from stressful events than male adolescents do
## Introduction 
The impact of stress on non-specific psychological distress, a construct involving cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms common across various mental disorders, varies by demographic factors like sex and ethnic groups. While non-specific psychological distress is commonly measured using validated tools such as the K6 and K10 scales (Kessler et al., 2002), prior studies have primarily focused on adults or populations in specific geographic locations (Matud et al., 2000).
Research Question: 
/ Do stressful life events in the past year influence a male or a female adolescent’s non-specific psychological distress?
Exploratory Question: 
/ Do stressful life events in the past year influence an Asian or a non-Asian adolescent’s non-specific psychological distress?

## Methods
**Participants**: 
/ N=732 adolescents from an open-source dataset in the Research on Adaptive Interests, Skills, and Environments (RAISE) study, a U.S. longitudinal study conducted in three waves from 2014 to 2019. This research uses data from Wave 2 (2016–2017), during which the survey was administered online for virtually all participants  (Hoyle, 2024).
**Variables**:
/ DV: 
PSYDIST2: the mean of the non-specific Psychological distress scale, measured by six items (KESPDS201-KESPDS206) (Hoyle, 2024).
/ IVs: 
SLET2: the number of stressful life events experienced in the past year, a summed index of 13 binary items (SLE01-SLE13) (Hoyle, 2024).
DEMGEN2: Sex [0 = Male, 1 = Female]  
DEMRA2013: Ethnic groups [0 = Non-Asian, 1 = Asian]
**Measure the internal consistency reliability**:
PSYDIST2: The Cronbach’s Alpha is 0.85 (no redundancy between items)
**Factor Analysis**: 
Only one factor can be identified from the analysis for PSYDIST2. 
The factor loadings range is from 0.504 to 0.854, indicating that all items meaningfully contribute to this construct.

## Results

Finding 1: The interaction effect of stressful life events on non-specific psychological distress for both male and female adolescents is statistically significant (***p<.001).
Finding 2: Moderation Analysis, sex significantly moderates the stress-distress relationship (***p < 0.001):
Finding 3: Female adolescents experience a stronger impact of stressful events on psychological distress compared to male adolescents, as indicated by the larger slope for female adolescents.

Finding 4: No significant interaction effect of ethnic groups on the relationship between stressful life events and non-specific psychological distress.
